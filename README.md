## Description and Instructions

Unsatisfied with the looks of the existing models of the poop emoji aka smiling turd, I made my own from scratch to be as faithful to the 2D original as possible. Eventually the best method proved to actually mimic the process of depositing a long sausage onto a flat surface, by applying the Curve modifier in Blender with a hand-crafted spiral. In a sense, I simulated the process of depositing poop using high-tech. Ah, the joys of technology!

Models are included for either:
1. **Single material printers:** `TurdEmoji-single_mat`
2. **Dual material printers:** `TurdEmoji-dual-or-multi-mat1` + `TurdEmoji-dual-mat2`
3. **Multi-material printers:** `TurdEmoji-dual-or-multi-mat1` + `TurdEmoji-multi-mat2` + `TurdEmoji-multi-mat3`

If you print the single model or the two-material model, the inside of the eyes can be coloured with a sharp permanent marker, which is easier than trying to paint them.

If you don't have a multi-material printer and want to manually print and assemble parts printed in different colors, look in the **parts-for-assembly** folder.

A Blender file with the non-merged parts is also available for easier remixing.

Printing should be easy, no rafts or supports required. You may need to force infill across the entire model to avoid that gaps occur at the seams between the ‘sausage’ due to shrinking of the material (especially with ABS).

I did my best to remove self-intersecting volumes, MeshLab still shows a few intersecting faces but it shouldn't cause any problems with any decent slicer.

**Note:** this model is released under a *Creative Commons - Attribution* license. The details can be [found here](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/) but in a nutshell it means you are pretty much free to do anything with it including selling prints, **if** you comply with the following condition:
* **‘Attribution’** means you must always provide a visible reference to the origin of the model both on the webpage where you sell the model, and inside the packaging of the actual physical product. A link to this page or even just “[Pile of Poo model by Dr. Lex](https://github.com/DrLex0/print3D-pile-of-poo-emoji)” suffices, as long as there is no possibility that anyone could believe you are the author of the model because you are selling it. *This is a very, very easy requirement* that doesn't incur any extra cost except a minute of your time. If you skip this tiny simple effort and catch enough attention, it might end up costing much more than you gained from it.


## How I printed this

I printed at 0.2mm layers, 15% infill, without any rafts or supports. The print shown in the photos is ABS at 75% size.

If you have trouble printing the mouth, you could enable supports for only that region.


## Updates

### 2017/06/11
Added multi-material files for printing the pupils in a third color on printers that can print with 3 materials.

### 2017/09/20
Added high poly count models for those wanting to print highly detailed poop.

### 2018/06/12
Updated the hiPoly models to have a better footprint to avoid warping around the mouth area, and some polygon pushing to encourage slicers to place seams inside the spiral crease.
